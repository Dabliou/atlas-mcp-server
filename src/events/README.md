# Event Management System

The event system provides a robust publish-subscribe mechanism for handling asynchronous operations
and communication between components in the Atlas Task Manager.

## Overview

The event system enables:

- Asynchronous communication between components
- Batch processing of operations
- Health monitoring and diagnostics
- Event-driven architecture support

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### EventManager

- Manages event subscriptions
- Handles event publishing
- Coordinates event processing
- Maintains event history

#### BatchProcessor

- Processes events in batches
- Optimizes event handling
- Manages event queues
- Handles batch failures

#### HealthMonitor

- Monitors event system health
- Tracks event processing metrics
- Detects system issues
- Reports system status

## Event Types

```typescript
interface TaskEvent {
  type: TaskEventType;
  taskId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

enum TaskEventType {
  CREATED = 'TASK_CREATED',
  UPDATED = 'TASK_UPDATED',
  DELETED = 'TASK_DELETED',
  STATUS_CHANGED = 'TASK_STATUS_CHANGED',
}
```

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Subscribe to events
eventManager.subscribe(TaskEventType.CREATED, async event => {
  console.log(`Task created: ${event.taskId}`);
});

// Publish events
await eventManager.publish({
  type: TaskEventType.CREATED,
  taskId: 'task-123',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});

// Batch processing
const batchProcessor = new BatchProcessor({
  batchSize: 100,
  processInterval: 1000,
});

batchProcessor.onBatch(async events => {
  // Process batch of events
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Event Design**

   - Keep events immutable
   - Include necessary context
   - Use clear event names
   - Version event schemas

2. **Error Handling**

   - Handle failed event processing
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Log event failures
   - Maintain event order

3. **Performance**

   - Use batch processing
   - Optimize event payload size
   - Monitor event queues
   - Handle backpressure

4. **Monitoring**

   - Track event metrics
   - Monitor system health
   - Alert on issues
   - Maintain event logs

5. **Testing**
   - Test event handlers
   - Verify event ordering
   - Simulate failures
   - Validate event schemas
