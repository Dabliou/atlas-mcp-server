# Modern Developer Portfolio Requirements for Casey Hand

Creating a cutting-edge, minimal portfolio that embodies the modern San Francisco tech aesthetic, featuring subtle interactive elements and a clean, sophisticated project showcase.

## Design Philosophy

### Modern Minimalism
- Ultra-clean, distraction-free layouts
- Strategic use of negative space
- Monochromatic color scheme with subtle accent colors
- Modern sans-serif typography (e.g., Inter, SF Pro)
- Minimal UI elements that appear on interaction
- Subtle borders and shadows
- Muted, professional color palette (typically whites, grays, with one accent)

### Interactive Elements
- Subtle particle system or fluid simulation following cursor movement
- Smooth gradient shifts based on mouse position
- Interactive background grid or mesh
- Subtle parallax effects on scroll
- Light/dark mode toggle with smooth transitions
- Elegant hover states with minimal animations
- Mouse position-based card tilting effects

## Technical Stack

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Framer Motion for fluid animations
- Three.js/React Three Fiber for background effects
- Tailwind CSS for minimal styling
- GSAP for advanced animations

## Core Features

### 1. Modern Project Gallery (Primary Focus)
- Minimal grid layout with generous spacing
- Interactive project cards that respond to cursor
- Hover states with subtle 3D transformations
- Project filtering with smooth transitions
- Features for each project:
  - Clean repository preview
  - Minimal tech stack indicators
  - GitHub stats with modern number formatting
  - Truncated descriptions that expand on hover
- Fluid transitions between views
- Real-time GitHub data
- Infinite scroll with minimal scrollbar

### 2. Minimalist Hero Section
- Clean, centered introduction
- Animated text appearance
- Interactive background element
- Subtle call-to-action
- Minimal navigation that appears on scroll

### 3. Professional Experience
- Minimal timeline design
- Clean skill representation
- Interactive tech stack visualization
- Achievement metrics with modern number formatting

### 4. About Section
- Concise, impactful copy
- Subtle section transitions
- Clean layout with ample whitespace
- Modern image treatment

### 5. Contact Section
- Minimal form design
- Interactive input fields
- Clean social media integration
- Subtle success/error states

## Interactive Elements Implementation

### Background Effects
