# Atlas MCP Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively use
Atlas MCP tools to manage and organize complex tasks. Each example showcases different aspects of
task management, hierarchy organization, and metadata utilization.

## Examples

### [Portfolio Website](./portfolio-website)

A comprehensive example of planning and organizing a modern developer portfolio website project.
Shows how an LLM can:

#### Task Organization

- Break down a complex web development project into manageable tasks
- Create clear milestones with specific objectives
- Establish proper task dependencies and relationships
- Structure tasks in a logical hierarchy

#### Technical Planning

- Define comprehensive technical requirements
- Specify dependencies and development tools
- Plan testing and quality assurance strategies
- Structure deployment and monitoring approaches

#### Metadata Management

- Organize tasks with meaningful metadata
- Track technical requirements and dependencies
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Document planning notes and implementation details

#### Project Documentation

- Create detailed project documentation
- Define development workflows
- Specify setup and deployment procedures
- Document monitoring and maintenance strategies

The portfolio website example demonstrates a complete project structure including:

- Project setup and infrastructure
- Core feature development
- Interactive elements implementation
- Testing and quality assurance
- Deployment and production setup

Files included:

- `atlas-tasks.db`: SQLite database containing the task hierarchy
- `task-hierarchy-full.json`: Complete task structure in JSON format
- `task-hierarchy-full.txt`: Human-readable task tree
- `README.md`: Comprehensive project documentation
- `prompt.md`: Original project requirements

This example serves as a reference for:

- Using Atlas MCP for complex project organization
- Structuring modern web development projects
- Managing technical requirements and dependencies
- Documenting development processes and workflows
